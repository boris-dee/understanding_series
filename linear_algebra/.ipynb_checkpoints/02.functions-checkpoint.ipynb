    "You might remember functions from your high school courses. What you saw at this time was actually a very very tiny fraction of the actual world of functions. Indeed, when we say *functions*, the first thing that comes to mind is the $f(x)=\\ldots$ notation, where $x$ (the argument) and $f(x)$ (the value) are both real numbers. Therefore, in high school, a function was a **mathematical relation** between a **real number** ($x$) and another **real number** ($f(x)$), hence the notation $f:\\mathbb{R}\\rightarrow\\mathbb{R}$.\n",
    "\n",
    "Example : $f(x)=x^2$. For $x=0.5$, we have $f(x)=0.25$.\n",

    "Here, we are going to expand this paradigm. That is, we are not going to make the assumption that $x$ and $f(x)$ are real numbers. From now on, $x$ and $f(x)$ can be real numbers, vectors, potatoes, soccer balls, whatever. They will just be **elements** from **sets**."
