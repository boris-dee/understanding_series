    "- When $a$ is an element and $E$ an ensemble:\n",
    "    - The assertion $a\\in E$ reads \"$a$ is in $E$\". It is true if $a$ is an element of $E$, and false otherwise.\n",
    "    - If $a$ is not an element of $E$, we write $a\\notin E$.\n",
    "- The notion of ensemble and element is relative, since an ensemble can itself be an element of another ensemble.\n",
    "- By convention, ensembles and elements are written with uppercase and lowercase letters, respectively."

    "\n",
    "    If there is one and only one element $x$, we write $\\exists! x\\in E \\quad A(x)$, which reads \"there exists a unique $x$ in $E$ for which we have $A(x)$\".\n",
