# The Understanding Series

The *Understanding Series* is a series of tutorials dedicated to the understanding of various concepts of mathematics, statistics, models, etc. that I've been dealing with during my journey to become a Machine Learning expert. The principle is simple: each time I have to understand a new concept, I'm making it an *Understanding Series* topic. Hopefully it will help newcomers in Data Science or those who seek domain knowledge (or both!) to understand concepts that may be a bit difficult to grasp at first.

While there are plenty of books and tutorials out there, I've always felt that something was missing for my understanding to be complete, in particular when dealing with mathematical or statistical concepts underlying many machine learning models. There have been many reasons for that, the main one being that equations wouldn't make sense to me at first, they wouldn't *talk* to me (yes, I like when equations talk to me :)). This could be because a visualisation was missing, or maybe because several steps of the mathematical derivation that lead to this equation were missing, or something else.

The *Understanding Series* is aimed at filling these blanks. These tutorials are written in a way that my understanding of the topic is complete, making no assumption whatsoever on the reader's prior skills in mathematics or statistics. If a skill is required to completely understand a particular topic, then references to other *Understanding Series* topics will be provided.

I hope you enjoy these series!
